<h1>Persona - Tomasita</h1>
<h2>Persona</h2>
<h3>Name</h3>
<p>Tomasita</p>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<h4>Devices</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chromebook</li>
    <li>Budget-friendly Android phone</li>
    <li>Secondhand Samsung tablet</li>
</ul>
<h4>Love/Hate</h4>
<p>Tomasita isn't a huge fan of technology, and definitely doesn't keep up with the latest devices.</p>
<h4>Proficiency</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, she is quite proficient with technology, and is usually drafted into being the family tech support.</p>
<h3>Attitudes and Needs</h3>
<p>Tomasita has used plenty of other tools to track things, such as Google Fit for her exercise and habit trackers for
other things, but these are all separate. If she wants to find out if her mood is better when she gets more consistent
exercise, she has to go back and forth between different apps and try to see a trend herself. She'd like to be able to
look in one place and have these trends highlighted for her. That way, she can see at a glance what kinds of things might
be influencing her mood.</p>
<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a proficient user, I want to view the trends in my mood and exercise levels, which I have been tracking for a month.</p>
<h2>Use Case and Interaction Flow</h2>
<p>Tomasita has been feeling a bit down the last few days after having had a great week last week. She's also been too 
busy to fit in her usual workouts, and she wants to see if her mood was also low last time she had to skip exercise.</p>
<p>Precondition: Tomasita has been making daily, or near-daily logs for a few weeks and is currently logged in to the site.</p>
<p>Postcondition: She has looked at a graph showing the data she's logged and has been able to draw a conclusion about 
factors that may be influencing her mood.</p>
