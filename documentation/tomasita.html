<h1>Persona - Tomasita</h1>
<h2>Persona</h2>
<h3>Name</h3>
<p>Tomasita</p>
<h3>Tech</h3>
<h4>Devices</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chromebook</li>
    <li>Budget-friendly Android phone</li>
    <li>Secondhand Samsung tablet</li>
</ul>
<h4>Love/Hate</h4>
<p>Tomasita isn't a huge fan of technology, and definitely doesn't keep up with the latest devices.</p>
<h4>Proficiency</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, she is quite proficient with technology, and is usually drafted into being the family tech support.</p>
<h3>Attitudes and Needs</h3>
<p>Tomasita has used plenty of other tools to track things, such as Google Fit for her exercise and habit trackers for
other things, but these are all separate. If she wants to find out if her mood is better when she gets more consistent
exercise, she has to go back and forth between different apps and try to see a trend herself. She'd like to be able to
look in one place and have these trends highlighted for her. That way, she can see at a glance what kinds of things might
be influencing her mood.</p>
<h2>User Story</h2>
<p>As a proficient user, I want to view the trends in my mood and exercise levels, which I have been tracking for two weeks.</p>
